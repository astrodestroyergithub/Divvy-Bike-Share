Summary: This paper entirely deals with understanding, analyzing and illustrating the multiple modes and forms of relationships between build environment (i.e., land-use, transportation system and urban design) and bike-share usage. Quite a many variances between the build environment and bike-usage were stated and described with some outliers in notable cases. Variance in relationship in the build environment across different mobility patterns, docked and dockless bike-share patterns, w.r.t. trip purpose, between arrival and departure patterns, based upon the day of week, etc. and the bike-share usage were elaborated. The paper concluded with a brief summary of the major findings of the authors and them encouraging the recommendations for the future research works.

[5] Examining factors associated with bike-and-ride (BnR) activities around metro stations in large-scale dockless bike-sharing systems:
Summary: The study attempted to examine the associations of BnR (bike and ride) activities with metro area w.r.t. DBS (dockless bike sharing) systems, in the city of Shanghai, China. The study signalled that BnR behaviors were affected by features like station features, land use, socio-demographics, roadway designs, transportation facilities, etc. Mainly four metrics were employed in the entire study to understand BnR behaviors from the perspective of different participators viz. local govt., DBS users, etc. The metrics were BnR trip count, shared-bike utilization rate, metro catchment area and BnR rate, for the assessment of BnR performance. The generalized additive model (GAM) was utilized to build statistical inference. Several statistical issues such as over-dispersion, skewness and spatial autocorrelation were addressed while modelling DBS usage. The spatial distribution of the 4 metrics suggested that shared bikes were oversupplied in the city center while undersupplied in the suburb. Based on other things, various other conclusions were drawn for comprehensive analysis.

[12] Unlimited-ride bike-share pass pricing revenue management for casual riders using only public data:
Summary: The authors scrutinized revenue management strategies for unlimited usage bike-share scenarios in their research paper. Citi Bike public data has been used by the authors for the overall analysis. Summarization of the basic data for understanding the behavioral patterns of the casual users and the number of trips that casual users take was estimated for relating between the two, because such data was not publicly available. The parameters of these distributions were derived from sample means and standard deviations using linear regression of daily short-term ticket sales and occasional passenger numbers. A path choice model was built using variables resampled from the fitted distribution by the bootstrap method. The multinomial logit model was used because it could represent not only individual vote probabilities but also aggregated market shares. As a result, the price combination of the two plans was optimized to maximize revenue based on estimated model output, and the impact on consumer surplus was quantified.

[13] An approach to modeling bike-sharing systems based on spatial equity concept:
Summary: This paper deals with providing a set of illustrative examples and performing a series of sensitivity analysis tests to propose an original model to find out the number and layout of the bike stations as well as the number of bicycles and free-racks for modeling bike-sharing systems based upon spatial equity concept aimimg towards reducing implementation and operational cost of the existing such systems. In the research paper proposed by the authors, a linear programming model was developed and tested to determine the number and layout of stations and the number of bikes and racks available at each station to set up and operate the BSS for each level of defined service, terms and conditions cost was minimized. The proposed linear mathematics problem minimized the setup and execution costs of a new BSS using a set of constraints that reflect the idea of ​​a balanced and fair level of service provided to all users of the system.

[14] Optimizing bike sharing systems: dynamic prediction using machine learning and statistical techniques and rebalancing:
Summary: Cities all around the world are increasingly getting concerned about the detrimental effects of increasing number of vehicles on their roads, viz., greater pollution, emission rates, congestion, etc., which has led many of then to take active steps in order to prevent such things. One of the most effective and efficient alternative and life-saver which has come out from the horizon in this regards is the usage of BSSs or bike-sharing systems. Many cities have also been seen to adopt BSSs to tackle such growing problems and more. This increased use of bicycles has prompted many cities to either expand existing systems or introduce new ones. Due to the unbalanced spatio-temporal demands of cycle tours, many cycle stations are either empty or full during the day. This could have a significant impact on the reliability and usefulness of BSS and encourage drivers to return to using their vehicles or choose alternative modes of transport, resulting in increased congestion and emissions and pollution may increase. This reduces the number of BSS users and reduces system revenue. Operators recognized the imbalance and began building more bike stations closer to each other with the aim of keeping them within a five-minute walk. However, this solution is both financially and practically difficult to implement. This extensive and enormous report and aggregation of research paper methodologies proposes a new generation of BSSs, in which some can be portable, i.e, it takes into account both the types of BSSs (docked and dockless bike-sharing systems). Specifically, the framework consists of two levels: We use fast, online, and incremental learning approaches to predict the number of bikes at stations and balance the system with wearable stations. The goal is a framework that solves the dynamic bike-sharing relocation problem to minimize unmet demand and increase or decrease user satisfaction. The dissertation by the authors contributes to the field in 5 ways. First, a multi-objective supervised clustering algorithm was developed to identify similarities in bicycle use with respect to time events. Second, a dynamic, interpretable and fast approach was developed for predicting the number of bikes at stations within a BSS. Third, a univariate inventory model was created using a Markov chain process that provides an optimal selection of bike levels at stations. The fourth was to explore the benefits of portable bike stations using an agent-based simulation approach as a proof of concept. Fifth, mathematical and heuristic approaches are proposed.
